`adt-arr-heap` directory contains benchmarks encoded using the same named [SV-COMP benchmarks](https://gitlab.com/sosy-lab/benchmarking/sv-benchmarks) by [TriCera](https://github.com/uuverifiers/tricera). These benchmarks make use of the (currently non-standard) [theory of heaps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04224) for encoding heap.

`adt-arr` directory contains benchmarks created using [heap2array](https://github.com/zafer-esen/heap2array) from the benchmarks in `adt-arr-heap` directory. In these benchmarks, all operations and sorts of the theory of heaps are encoded using the theories of arrays and ADTs.

More benchmarks will be uploaded soon!

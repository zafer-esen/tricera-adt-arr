Benchmarks created using the same named [SV-COMP benchmarks](https://gitlab.com/sosy-lab/benchmarking/sv-benchmarks) by [TriCera](https://github.com/uuverifiers/tricera) and [heap2array](https://github.com/zafer-esen/heap2array).

All benchmarks contain ADTs with arrays, which are used in encoding the program heap.

More benchmarks will be uploaded soon!
